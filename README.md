## Privacy

All data is stored locally on your device. Data synchronization is done using PeerJS, which uses WebRTC for a
Peer-to-Peer connection between browsers.

### Extensions

Privacy is something you shouldn't have to think about. Using the browser extension LibRedirect, you can automatically
redirect YouTube Music links to Beatbump. For more information, please visit the
[LibRedirect Repo](https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect).
